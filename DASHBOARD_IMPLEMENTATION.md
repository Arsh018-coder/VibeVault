# VibeVault Role-Based Dashboard System

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive role-based dashboard system for your VibeVault event management platform. The system provides different dashboard experiences for **Attendees** and **Organizers** with smooth navigation and full functionality.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Role-Based Authentication & Routing**
- Updated `AppRoutes.jsx` with proper role-based routing
- Created `RoleBasedDashboard` component that automatically redirects users to the appropriate dashboard
- Updated header navigation to show a unified "Dashboard" link for all authenticated users

### 2. **Attendee Dashboard** (`/attendee-dashboard`)
- **Complete redesign** with modern, responsive UI
- Shows purchased tickets with detailed information (event name, date, time, venue, booking code)
- **"No tickets purchased"** message with call-to-action to browse events when user hasn't purchased any tickets
- Integration with booking API to fetch user's ticket data
- Quick actions section for easy navigation

### 3. **Organizer Dashboard** (`/organizer`)
- **Enhanced existing dashboard** with full event management capabilities
- Stats overview (total events, upcoming events, tickets sold, revenue)
- Recent events list with detailed information
- **Event creation functionality** with comprehensive form
- Event editing and management features
- Quick actions for common organizer tasks

### 4. **Event Creation Form** (`/organizer/events/new`)
- **Complete rewrite** with modern, user-friendly interface
- Form validation and error handling
- Support for both physical and virtual events
- **Integrated ticket type creation** within the event creation flow
- Proper database integration with transaction support
- Category selection (with seeded sample categories)
- Auto-slug generation for events

### 5. **Enhanced Server-Side Support**
- **Updated event controller** to support creating events with ticket types in a single transaction
- Proper error handling and validation
- Category seeding script for sample data
- Enhanced API endpoints for dashboard functionality

## 📁 Key Files Modified/Created

### Client-Side (`/client/src/`)
```
routes/AppRoutes.jsx                     # ✅ Updated with role-based routing
components/common/Header/Header.jsx      # ✅ Updated navigation

## 🚀 How It Works

4. Can browse events to purchase tickets

### For Organizers:
1. User logs in with role "ORGANIZER"
2. Clicks "Dashboard" in header → automatically redirected to `/organizer`
3. Sees comprehensive dashboard with stats and event management
4. Can create new events with full details and ticket types
5. Can manage existing events
